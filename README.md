# Facebook

In order to demonstrate my abilities to reproduce any website mock-up (<strong>interface</strong>) <br>
I chose to re-create from scratch 3 three famous social media: <strong> YouTube, Netflix and Facebook </strong> <br>
The current one <strong> Facebook </strong> is <strong> Responsive </strong> and has a different style: <strong>Saint Valentin Theme</strong> <br>
I Integrated it with: <strong> HTML and SASS</strong>
